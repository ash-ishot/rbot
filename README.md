Please note we are not responsible for if anything happens to your bot account. It is your responsibility to keep the cookie and token away from anyone you don't trust. qbot uses noblox.js to interact with Roblox API with your bot cookie, and discord.js to interact with the Discord API with your bot token. Do not share your config.json file with anyone once filled out.

Please also note that Discord has a TOS for its API: https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal

This TOS is being updated August 15th, 2020 and will require all bots to have a privacy policy (even if it just says you don't collect personal information and has a way to contact you with any privacy concerns). qbot does not have this built in so you will need to add this yourself. 

More info can be found on the [Discord Developers](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) server in [this](https://discord.com/channels/613425648685547541/697489244649816084/728031320625905794) message.

It is your responsibility to make sure your use of qbot is not against the TOS of any services it uses.
